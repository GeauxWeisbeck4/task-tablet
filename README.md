# Task Tablet

Task Tablet is personal productivity CLI tool created with Deno as part of my [30 Days of Projects](https://weismindcreativestudio.leantime.io/projects/changeCurrentProject/3) blog series. This tool makes it easy to keep track of your tasks as you work and logs the data to a file that is stored in your chosen directory. Create tasks and keep track of how long it takes to complete them.

## Work in Progress

I am still creating this for the blog post tonight - check back in a few hours!
